# Scheduling-using-Genetic-Algorithms
This project is concerned in solving the Scheduling Problem (non-bipartite matching) using genetic algorithms, using an effecient encoding for the chromosomes, and a combination measures chromosome-quality measures combined in fitness function.
## Prerequisites:
* Matlab
* Genetic Algorithm Toolbox
* JRE 8 for input file maker programme(optional to use)
## Project Structure
* implmntation folder contain matlab functions
* input folder contain input smaple files and input file maker programme
## Running the Program
Main function is runScheduling
input: file name , number of generations(optional), fix rng
       1 file name is input file absolute/relative path
       2 number of generations the algorithm will reach
       3 fix random number generator to generate the same output every time (used during testing)
output: graphical animation of scheduling + best individual + best fitness + solution matrix
